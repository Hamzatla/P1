                <p>The pyramids of Giza were royal tombs built for three different pharaohs. The northernmost and
                    oldest
                    pyramid of the group was <br> built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty.
                    Called
                    the
                    Great Pyramid, it is the largest of the three.</p>

                <h1>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
                <h3>One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the great pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the
                most famous and discussed structures in history. These massive monuments were unsurpassed in height for
                thousands of years after their construction and continue to amaze and enthrall us with their
                overwhelming mass and seemingly impossible perfection. Their exacting orientation and mind-boggling
                construction has elicited many theories about their origins, including unsupported suggestions that they
                had extra-terrestrial impetus. However, by examining the several hundred years prior to their emergence
                on the Giza plateau, it becomes clear that these incredible structures were the result of many
                experiments, some more successful than others, and represent an apogee in line with the development of
                the royal mortuary complex.</p>

                    <h1>Backstory</h1>
                    <p>We are used to seeing the pyramids at Giza in alluring photographs, where they appear as massive
                        and remote monuments rising up from an open, barren desert. Visitors might be surprised to find,
                        then, that there is a golf course and resort only a few hundred feet from the Great Pyramid, and
                        that the burgeoning suburbs of Giza (part of the greater metropolitan area of Cairo) have
                        expanded right up to the foot of the Sphinx. This urban encroachment and the problems that come
                        with it—such as pollution, waste, illegal activities, and auto traffic—are now the biggest
                        threats to these invaluable examples of global cultural heritage.</p>

                    <h1>Three pyramids, three rulers</h1>
                    <p>The three primary pyramids on the Giza plateau were built over the span of three generations by
                        the rulers Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Each pyramid was part of a royal mortuary complex that
                        also included a temple at its base and a long stone causeway (some nearly 1 kilometer in length)
                        leading east from the plateau to a valley temple on the edge of the floodplain.</p>
                    <p>The famous pyramids of Khufu (Cheops), Khafra (Chephren), and Menkaura (Mycerinus) at Gizeh were
                        erected by Snofru's successors. Later generations built smaller monuments, but the large
                        monuments of the Fourth Dynasty continued to impress the people. The pyramids are the only one
                        of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that survives more or less intact.</p>
